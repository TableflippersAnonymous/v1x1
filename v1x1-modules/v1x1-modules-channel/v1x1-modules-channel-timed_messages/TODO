Known issues:
- Cannot delete identical TimerEntrys from a timer due to countMatching()
- Currently running timers don't get disabled when the module is disabled

Things to do:
- Support for modifying intervals isn't built in, but easy to add later
- Auto enable/disable on online/offline
- Expose the "always on" flag in the CUI
- Finish enable/disable CUI
- CUI !timers list ?
- Add restrictions on timer duration
- Cache Kraken responses for "is streaming"
